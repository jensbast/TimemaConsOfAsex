# TimemaConsOfAsex

This is the repository for the collected scripts used in the study "Consequences of asexuality in natural populations" (Bast et al.).


### Components

- [pNpS estimates](pNpS) - scripts for calculation of synonimous and non-synonimous SNPs
- [dNdS estimates](https://github.com/AsexGenomeEvol/dN-dS-ratio-estimates) - to be linked here
- [augment_OG.ipynb](augment_OG.ipynb) - script (ipython notebook) to mine ortholog variants from the OMA ouput
- [polymorphisms_processing.R](polymorphisms_processing.R) - R script to process output from pNpS program and calculate pS, pN and pNpS
- [commands_orth_algn_raxml](commands_orth_algn_raxml) - one-liner collection for getting the shared orthologous groups for all ten species, aligning them and running RAxML and preparation to run the dN/dS estimates
